# CMSC_202_Poker_Hands_Project
This project implements two classes: Card and Pokerhand, and includes hand rank and comparison functions.
Enumerated types are used for suit, card value, and poker hand type.

Bubble sorting is used to sort cards based on their point value.

Poker hand types including one pair, two pair, flush, royal flush, straight, straight flush, full house, four of a kind, three of a kind, and high card are found and hand scores can be directly compared against one another.
This project implements the backbone of a full poker game.

The play5 test file illustrates a simple case of comparing a five card hand with another five card hand.

The play7 test file uses the Card and PokerHand classes to pick the best five cards to keep at the end of game of Seven Card Stud.

The mytest file is used to test ranked hand creation and verify that comparison works properly.
